summary: "My team and I created a C++ program to simulate a hotel database."
---

In my programming structures class, I worked on a team of six students to create and implement a simulation of a system that mirrors software used in the hotel industry. This simulator included functionality such as
searching, adding, deleting, and updating rooms. Alongside this, the simulator could also gather customer data and check them in/out of rooms.

Personal duties on this project include:
- Pulling customer/room details from the booking database for a "Guest Summary" function
- Implementing a search function for rooms in the database
