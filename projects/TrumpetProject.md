I've been playing the trumpet for over 13 years and have played in the UH Marching Band during the 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2022 seasons. I wanted to make an homage to the marching band for facillitating musical excellence for over 100 years by arranging one of my favorite pieces into a trumpet quartet!
