summary: "My team and I created a C++ program to simulate a library database system."
---
As part of a mid-term project for my Program Structure class, I worked in a team of six other students to create a simulation of a library database in C++. The main functionality of this system consisted of book indexing via its title/ISBN/genre/author. 
Other important aspects included book searching, adding/deleting, and editing.

Personal duties on this project include:
- Implementing an "edit book" feature
- Implementing library database search functionality
