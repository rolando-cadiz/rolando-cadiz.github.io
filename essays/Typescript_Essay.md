  You know that feeling when you run into an old friend somewhere unexpectedly? That sense of familiarity makes it so you can jump right back into your old jokes and quips that it feels like you were never separated. To me, that was what it was like learning Typescript.
For context, my very first program ever was coded in Java. Now, Java is, in my opinion, a wonderful language to learn as a beginning computer science student; not too complicated (i.e. Assembly) and not too simple (i.e. Python), not that there's anything wrong with simple. 
It's just that I believe it's best for a student to jump right into the 'coals' and learn through experience how robust a language like Java can be.

## Similarity to Java
When I started learning Typescript I felt at ease because it really just felt like Java. Both are OOPs (Object Oriented Programs), are very similar syntactically, and both have static typing. I was able to use my previous experiences with Java (about two semesters worth) and just 
jump right into it. Things like declaring variables, creating functions, calling functions, and other things are all done pretty much like in Java. Even some functions like '.ToString()' are the same! I found this to be very useful while learning Javascript/Typescript via 
FreeCodeCamp's Legacy JavaScript Algorithms and DataStructures course. And, even though there are a few differences, I breezed through all 113 learning modules in just a few hours.

## New Contender For My Top Three
I enjoy using Typescript a lot and now. I'm thinking it might replace Python's spot in my list of top three favorite programming languages, the other two being Java and C++. I think I see a pattern here (hint: it's my attraction OOP!). Although my experience with this language is very limited,
I can already tell that it's a very versatile language. As a prospecting software developer, I believe going in-depth with Typescript will be beneficial to me since one aspect of this language is that it's flexible in its typing system, being that it's very suitable for web development and user 
interactions where inputs can be unpredictable.

## My Experience Using Typescript and WOD's
In my class, ICS 314 - Software Engineering I, we have mini coding practice sessions called WODs (Workouts of the Day). During these, we are timed and given a rating based on our finish time. In my first practice WOD, I was able to finish a simple program on my third attempt with a time of 3:30, a very decent time.
One reason I was able to achieve this is because of how easy it felt to code in Typescript. For our first non-practice WOD however, I wasn't able to finish in the allotted time. This is because there were a few syntax issues that I had to spend time looking up as well as some logical errors in my code. I 
think the WODs are helping me become a better developer because I am forced to code faster while under pressure. I'm hoping in the future, as I learn more advanced Typescript syntax and logic, I can pass my WODs with flying colors.

## Final thoughts
As I progress on my journey to become a software developer, I hope to be able to master not only Typescript but other programming languages too. Typescript is but one of the many tools that will be necessary for me to learn in order to reach success.
