To employers in the software development industry, communicating effectively is a valued skill they look for in every potential candidate. A one-man army that can out-code everyone in the room is useless if they can't effectively communicate information between colleagues and managers. 
thus, it's important to know what effective communication looks like. Things like requesting specific tools/technology, organizing a strategy, gathering information from sources to solve a problem, etc. These are all basic forms of effective communication. In particular, being able to ask
SMART questions will improve your chances at information gathering and will more often than not lead you to a fix for your specific problem. I continue this writing by showing you two example questions, one being the smart way (as written about [here](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric Raymond in 'How to ask questions the smart way'),
and one being the not-so-smart way. These questions were gathered from StackOverflow and links will be provided to you so you may explore the full questions and their responses.

## Before Asking a Question
It is advised that before asking a question, you should search for your answer via these methods:
  "- Try to find an answer by searching the archives of the forum or mailing list you plan to post to.

  - Try to find an answer by searching the Web.

  - Try to find an answer by reading the manual.

  - Try to find an answer by reading a FAQ.

  - Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation.

  - Try to find an answer by asking a skilled friend.

  - If you're a programmer, try to find an answer by reading the source code."
  (Raymond, 2014). 

## Asking a Smart Question
Eric Raymond's essay includes a lengthy guideline to assist those who read it an optimal way to ask a question. If you follow them, you are more likely to find an answer. Let's take a look at [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79401857/jenkins-offline-and-plugins-installation-failed-issue-in-azure-windows-10-vm) to see if it was asked smartly.

Jenkins offline and plugins installation failed issue in Azure Windows 10 VM


I tried installing Jenkins on my Windows 10 Azure VM, but during the initial configuration, it shows that Jenkins is offline just before the plugins installation page. enter image description here

After referring to some blogs, I changed the jenkins.xml file by updating https://updates.jenkins.io/update-center.json to http://updates.jenkins.io/update-center.json.

After restarting the Jenkins service, I tried configuring Jenkins again, but this time I couldn’t install the suggested plugins. All plugin installations failed. I also tried adding the certificate to the Java cacerts file. The server has internet access.

Could someone help me rectify this issue?

Jenkins version : Jenkins 2.479.3 LTS Java : open jdk version 17.0.14

The asker's header is meaningful and specific. In Raymond's essay, he mentions "object-deviation", a method of generating a header in a way that shows what is having the issue (object) and what is the issue (deviation). Although a question is not asked directly, we as a reader can clearly understand 
the initial issue that the asker is facing is a failed plugin installation in an Azure Windows 10 virtual machine. As we look at the body of the question itself, the asker shows that they have tried referencing other sources for information before asking for help, thus we know that they are not, in Raymond's words, a "lazy sponge".
Furthermore, the asker writes clearly, taking care to write with grammatically correct spelling and syntax. This helps define the body of the question and conveys to us as the reader the exact issue with less of a chance of miscommunication due to a spelling error. The asker continues the body by describing their problem
chronologically and in a precise manner. They even include an image to show greater detail of the issue. This question follows many of Raymond's points and we can confidently say that this is a smart question!

## Asking a Dumb Question


## My Experience Using Typescript and WODs
In my class, ICS 314 - Software Engineering I, we have mini coding practice sessions called WODs (Workouts of the Day). During these, we are timed and given a rating based on our finish time. In my first practice WOD, I was able to finish a simple program on my third attempt with a time of 3:30, a very decent time.
One reason I was able to achieve this is because of how easy it felt to code in Typescript. For our first non-practice WOD however, I wasn't able to finish in the allotted time. This is because there were a few syntax issues that I had to spend time looking up as well as some logical errors in my code. I 
think the WODs are helping me become a better developer because I am forced to code faster while under pressure. I'm hoping in the future, as I learn more advanced Typescript syntax and logic, I can pass my WODs with flying colors.

## Final thoughts
As I progress on my journey to become a software developer, I hope to be able to master not only Typescript but other programming languages too. Typescript is but one of the many tools that will be necessary for me to learn to reach success.
