## Introduction
The idea of using artificial intelligence (AI) to make mundane day-to-day tasks easier has always been prevalent in modern society.
However, it is only somewhat recent that AI has taken a foothold in our education system. Gone are the days of using Chegg, StackOverflow, online forums, etc.
The correct answer to your homework problem is but a few typed (or copy/pasted) sentences away. Some may say any usage of AI is cheating, and in a way, they're right.
You can, of course, use it to get homework answers, but all you're really doing is cheating yourself out of crucial knowledge. On the other hand, AI can be one of the greatest
tutors you've ever had. Having an all-access pass to what is essentially a massive library of knowledge that, if used correctly, is sort of like cheating the system
(but in a good way, if that makes sense). Aside from education, AI has also made its way into the software engineering landscape. Forgot the specific syntax for your coding language
of choice, but don't want to go hunt through forums or StackOverflow? Ask ChatGPT. Want your IDE to use code you've already written to understand the context of what you're trying to accomplish and
then write code on the fly for you before you even finish a for loop? Install Co-Pilot. Yeah, AI isn't leaving us coders anytime soon; it's now an essential pocket item when completing any project.
Personally, I've used numerous AI tools such as Photomath, ChatGPT, and Co-pilot. In ICS 314, the use of AI is seemingly encouraged and helps you learn various languages and frameworks 
faster than if you hadn't otherwise used them. In our short semester, we are tasked with learning HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Next.JS, Node.JS, React, PostgreSQL, as well as all of their libraries. I don't think
I could have fit all that learning in one semester without having AI, to be quite honest. 

## My Personal Experience With AI In ICS 314

## WODS
Throughout my time in ics 314 I used AI heavily and want to walk you through how I used it to learn effociently. Lets start with the at home experience WODS. These were often the first time using/learning new technologies as well as incorporating ones that we had already learned. I think AI was most cruicial here as syntax errors were one of the common issues I faced, especially when learbing HTML. Next are the in class practice WODS (not graded). AI here was less important I think because I usually had the experience nesscesary to complete most of them, however syntax and some logic issues had me asking Co-Pilot for help often. The actual graded WODS were timed and often difficult to complete. Even though I had multiple AI tools to aide me, I wasn't able to complete about half of them in the required amount of time and this should clue you in on the fact that AI isnt the be all end all tool for coding. Unless you know the right questions and context to give it, it can easily lead you astray.

## Essays
I like to believe that i'm a decent enough writer that I dont need to use AI as a crutch. As often as I can, barring any time constraints, every essay I write is with my own two hands, or as of writing this on my phone, my two thumbs! Since essays are supposed to be made of ones own thoughts and opinions, I find it disingenuous to use AI to write them for me.

## Final Project
The final project for ICS 314 has us working in groups of 3-5 students to create a functioning website with a database. It is designed in a way such that we must use our knowledge of all the course material covered throughout the semester and additional technologies if we find it applicable. Having said that, AI has been extremely useful here. There are so many layers to the current project im working on that I dont think I could have gotten as far as I have without it. Troubleshooting bugs has never been easier since I can copy and paste the error message into ChatGPT and it will tell me exactly what part of my code is causing me grief. Im sure my group mates would all agree when I say AI was an important tool in completing the project.

## Learning New Concepts, Answering In-class Questions, and Asking Smart-questions on Discord

As I mentioned earlier, AI is like the ultimate tutor. Any question you have regarding material can he answered at your convenience and pace. Again, very crucial to learning. Answering questions in class did not seem to be affected by students usage of AI as there was no reason to since you either knew the answer or you didnt. One thing I did notice however were the lack of Smart-questions being asked. I suppose the reason is due to the fact that AI is always ready to answer your question. Really the only questions I saw asked were administrative type questions like due dates for assignments and what not.

## Coding Example
An interesting example ill provide is that in the Bootstrap-React-Next.JS stack, some files require you to put 'use client' at the top. I always wondered why it was nescessary until ChatGPT told me that some functions are better to be ran on the client side such as logic/data structure processing, while other functions such as API routing are often done serverside, which makes sense to me. 

## Explaining Code
If you code often you know that sometimes your codebase becomes a mess of different functions with dozens of variable references and calls. It can be a daunting task trying to read the code line by line. Thats why Co-Pilot with its built in code explanation function is so great. I used it a few times when I had been at the tail end of a long coding session and sat at my screen staring blankly while trying to understand the big picture of what I was writing. It gave clean and concise explanations without me having to think. Awesome!

## Writing Code
Obviously, AI can write code. However, it doesnt work one hundred percent of the time, especially if not given exact specifications and context for what you want the code to do. Thats where AI fails I think. If you dont understand what it is that you are trying to accomplish, how can the AI? As an example, in my final project, I was trying to figure out how to upload images to the site and forgot to mention that each image is user uploaded. This piece of missing context made ChatGPT misunderstand my goal and I had to re-factor my solution numerous times.

## Documenting Code
This can easily be done without AI as its really not all that difficult to read each line and understand what that line of code does. I dont use AI for such things unless there is a time constraint. AI would certainly improve the speed at which it can be done I believe it to be an important skill to be able to understand the code youre writing at least.

## Quality Assurance
I found Co-Pilot to be very useful for fixing ES lint errors and ChatGPT to be not always correct. Because I had used Co-Pilot so much, I learned how to write code in the style that ES lint likes and thus required less help fixing them. This has saved me alot of time and effort fixing linting errors.

## Other Uses In ICS 314
AI has been instrumental not just in actual coding but also understanding what being a software engineer actually is and how they do things. I recall asking ChatGPT if my setup for the project is similar to how one working in the software industry would. Thankfully I must have picked up a few things sub-counciously because I was pretty darn close.
