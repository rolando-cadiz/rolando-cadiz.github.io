## Introduction
The idea of using artificial intelligence (AI) to make mundane day-to-day tasks easier has always been prevalent in modern society.
However, it is only somewhat recent that AI has taken a foothold in our education system. Gone are the days of using Chegg, StackOverflow, online forums, etc.
The correct answer to your homework problem is but a few typed (or copy/pasted) sentences away. Some may say any usage of AI is cheating, and in a way, they're right.
You can, of course, use it to get homework answers, but all you're really doing is cheating yourself out of crucial knowledge. On the other hand, AI can be one of the greatest
tutors you've ever had. Having an all-access pass to what is essentially a massive library of knowledge that, if used correctly, is sort of like cheating the system
(but in a good way, if that makes sense). Aside from education, AI has also made its way into the software engineering landscape. Forgot the specific syntax for your coding language
of choice, but don't want to go hunt through forums or StackOverflow? Ask ChatGPT. Want your IDE to use code you've already written to understand the context of what you're trying to accomplish and
then write code on the fly for you before you even finish a for loop? Install Co-Pilot. Yeah, AI isn't leaving us coders anytime soon; it's now an essential pocket item when completing any project.
Personally, I've used numerous AI tools such as Photomath, ChatGPT, and Co-pilot. In ICS 314, the use of AI is seemingly encouraged and helps you learn various languages and frameworks 
faster than if you hadn't otherwise used them. In our short semester, we are tasked with learning HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Next.JS, Node.JS, React, PostgreSQL, as well as all of their libraries. I don't think
I could have fit all that learning in one semester without having AI, to be quite honest.
