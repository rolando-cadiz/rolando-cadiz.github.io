## Introduction
The idea of using artificial intelligence (AI) to make mundane day-to-day tasks easier has always been prevalent in modern society.
However, it is only somewhat recent that AI has taken a foothold in our education system. Gone are the days of using Chegg, StackOverflow, online forums, etc.
The correct answer to your homework problem is but a few typed (or copy/pasted) sentences away. Some may say any usage of AI is cheating, and in a way, they're right.
You can, of course, use it to get homework answers, but all you're really doing is cheating yourself out of crucial knowledge. On the other hand, AI can be one of the greatest
tutors you've ever had. Having an all-access pass to what is essentially a massive library of knowledge that, if used correctly, is sort of like cheating the system
(but in a good way, if that makes sense). Aside from education, AI has also made its way into the software engineering landscape. Forgot the specific syntax for your coding language
of choice, but don't want to go hunt through forums or StackOverflow? Ask ChatGPT. Want your IDE to use code you've already written to understand the context of what you're trying to accomplish and
then write code on the fly for you before you even finish a for loop? Install Co-Pilot. Yeah, AI isn't leaving us coders anytime soon; it's now an essential pocket item when completing any project.
Personally, I've used numerous AI tools such as Photomath, ChatGPT, and Co-pilot. In ICS 314, the use of AI is seemingly encouraged and helps you learn various languages and frameworks 
faster than if you hadn't otherwise used them. In our short semester, we are tasked with learning HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Next.js, Node.js, React, PostgreSQL, as well as all of their libraries. I don't think
I could have fit all that learning in one semester without having AI, to be quite honest. 

## My Personal Experience With AI In ICS 314

## WODS
Throughout my time in ICS 314, I used AI heavily and want to walk you through how I used it to learn efficiently. Let's start with the at-home experience WODS. These were often the first time using/learning new technologies, as well as incorporating ones that we had already learned. I think AI was most crucial here, as syntax errors were one of the common issues I faced, especially when learning HTML. Next are the in-class practice WODS (not graded). AI here was less important, I think, because I usually had the experience necessary to complete most of them, however, syntax and some logic issues had me asking Co-Pilot for help often. The actual graded WODS were timed and often difficult to complete. Even though I had multiple AI tools to aid me, I wasn't able to complete about half of them in the required amount of time, and this should clue you in on the fact that AI isn't the be-all end-all tool for coding. Unless you know the right questions and context to give it, it can easily lead you astray.

## Essays
I like to believe that I'm a decent enough writer that I don't need to use AI as a crutch. As often as I can, barring any time constraints, every essay I write is with my own two hands, or as of writing this on my phone, my two thumbs! Since essays are supposed to be made of one's own thoughts and opinions, I find it disingenuous to use AI to write them for me.

## Final Project
The final project for ICS 314 has us working in groups of 3-5 students to create a functioning website with a database. It is designed in a way such that we must use our knowledge of all the course material covered throughout the semester and additional technologies if we find them applicable. Having said that, AI has been extremely useful here. There are so many layers to the current project I'm working on that I don't think I could have gotten as far as I have without it. Troubleshooting bugs has never been easier since I can copy and paste the error message into ChatGPT and it will tell me exactly what part of my code is causing me grief. I'm sure my group mates would all agree when I say AI was an important tool in completing the project.

## Learning New Concepts, Answering In-class Questions, and Asking Smart-questions on Discord

As I mentioned earlier, AI is like the ultimate tutor. Any question you have regarding the material can he answered at your convenience and pace. Again, very crucial to learning. Answering questions in class did not seem to be affected by students' usage of AI, as there was no reason to, since you either knew the answer or you didn't. One thing I did notice, however, was the lack of Smart-questions being asked. I suppose the reason is that AI is always ready to answer your question. Really, the only questions I saw asked were administrative-type questions like due dates for assignments and whatnot.

## Coding Example
An interesting example I'll provide is that in the Bootstrap-React-Next.JS stack, some files require you to put 'use client' at the top. I always wondered why it was necessary until ChatGPT told me that some functions are better to be run on the client side, such as logic/data structure processing, while other functions, such as API routing, are often done server-side, which makes sense to me. 

## Explaining Code
If you code often, you know that sometimes your codebase becomes a mess of different functions with dozens of variable references and calls. It can be a daunting task trying to read the code line by line. That's why Co-Pilot, with its built-in code explanation function, is so great. I used it a few times when I had been at the tail end of a long coding session and sat at my screen, staring blankly while trying to understand the big picture of what I was writing. It gave clean and concise explanations without me having to think. Awesome!

## Writing Code
Obviously, AI can write code. However, it doesn't work one hundred percent of the time, especially if not given exact specifications and context for what you want the code to do. That's where AI fails, I think. If you don't understand what it is that you are trying to accomplish, how can the AI? As an example, in my final project, I was trying to figure out how to upload images to the site and forgot to mention that each image is user-uploaded. This piece of missing context made ChatGPT misunderstand my goal, and I had to re-factor my solution numerous times.

## Documenting Code
This can easily be done without AI, as it's really not all that difficult to read each line and understand what that line of code does. I don't use AI for such things unless there is a time constraint. AI would certainly improve the speed at which it can be done. I believe it to be an important skill to be able to understand the code you're writing, at least.

## Quality Assurance
I found Co-Pilot to be very useful for fixing ES lint errors, and ChatGPT to be not always correct. Because I had used Co-Pilot so much, I learned how to write code in the style that ES lint likes and thus required less help fixing them. This has saved me a lot of time and effort fixing linting errors.

## Other Uses In ICS 314
AI has been instrumental not just in actual coding but also in understanding what being a software engineer actually is and how they do things. I recall asking ChatGPT if my setup for the project is similar to how an enterprise software would be. Thankfully, I must have picked up a few things subconsciously because I was pretty darn close.

## Impact On My Learning and Understanding
AI has certainly shown its benefits for me as I learn new technologies. I feel like I can learn just about anything now. It's as if I have the world's collective knowledge at my fingertips. I now enter each semester more confident than the last, ready to learn alongside my AI study buddy. However, there may be a downside. The heavy usage of AI may be a crutch that prevents learning on my own. Back in my high school days, there were no AI tools readily available like ChatGPT to help you study. One had to "hit the books". To this day, I loathe textbooks, but I understand their benefits, too. I would say, though, that AI overall has enhanced my learning of software engineering concepts.

## Practical Applications of AI In General
In the real world, AI has a plethora of applicable uses. From the finance industry's AI stock predictors to AI simulations of data in various fields of research, AI can (almost) do it all. In regard to the software industry, AI overuse may be degrading the quality of coders in general, but perhaps that is the price we pay for efficiency. 

## Challenges I Faced 
Aside from the learning opportunities I've had, AI has let me down a few times. Sometimes AI couldn't get me out of a rut, even when I needed it most. This happened most often when working on front-end UX/UI code. It doesn't always understand exactly how you want something to look, and thus, a lot of hair-pulling moments have arisen throughout my time working through the course experiences. 

## AI Tutor Versus Traditional Teaching
With software engineering, a lot of the techniques one can learn in a traditional classroom can also be learned just as easily, if not more easily, by AI. A lot of what we learn is syntactical, theoretical, and technical, things that ChatGPT is very good at teaching. One thing it's not good at, though, is the personal component. Professors with experience in the industry are more suited to teach students how one should conduct oneself in an interview or meeting, for example, rather than AI. The one thing humans have over AI is being able to experience real-life scenarios and provide insights based on those experiences. 

## The Future of AI In Software Engineering
I foresee AI becoming far more advanced in the coming years. I hear UH is offering a master's degree in AI or something along those lines, and if that's any indication of where this technology is heading, then we can be assured that we are just at the beginning of AI evolution. I have a feeling AI will still be heavily frowned upon and/or banned in many classes, but I hope some professors will understand that AI can be used in conjunction with their methods of teaching to enhance student learning. One suggestion for incorporating AI into the classroom would be to have it review code that students have written without AI assistance, and then let students take note of where they could improve. Whether it be syntax errors or logical errors.

## Conclusion
AI has been a transformative part of my learning experience in ICS 314. It's helped me understand complex topics, solve bugs that would have otherwise taken hours, and learn new frameworks at a pace that would be difficult to achieve through traditional study alone. But as helpful as AI has been, it’s not without its issues. It can lead you astray without the right context, and relying on it too heavily can hinder understanding of the material. I’ve learned that the key is to balance using AI not as a crutch, but as a tutor that enhances my learning when I’ve already put in the effort to understand the material myself. While AI can’t replace the experience and wisdom of human instructors, it can absolutely complement them. I’m excited as well as a little anxious about how AI will change the landscape of software engineering. If used "correctly, I really do think it can make us not just faster developers, but smarter and more capable ones too.
