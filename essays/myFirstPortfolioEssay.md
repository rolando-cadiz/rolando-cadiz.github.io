Before I started attending college, I didn't have a clue as to what a program was; much less how to create one. All I knew was that I liked computers and wanted to dive into something related to such. 

  Throughout my life I've always been fascinated by computers and software, eyeing up the pieces of tech hardware at my local RadioShack in my elementary school days to having built my first computer at fifteen. 
After high school, I was a bit lost as I didn't have a plan of action, and began working as a pizza delivery driver. Over time I began to feel stagnant, I mean I enjoyed the job but I also wanted something more. I didn't want to be delivering food for the rest of my life. Toward the end of my employment, I reconnected with an old friend who had started
working at Amazon as a software engineer. As we talked, I came to the realization that I could combine my passion for computers with a career in software development!  It was then that I decided to enroll as an undergrad student at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa to obtain my B.S. in computer science.

## Freshman year
Being out of school for five years, I really didn't know what to expect on my first day of college. I double and triple-checked that I had the right room numbers for each of my classes, made sure I knew where each building was, and even arrived at school an hour early in case of any delays. I was so excited to finally start my progression to a new career.
Freshman year could be summarized as a year of figuring out if I really like software development or not. And, as it turns out, I did like it. My first ever experience with coding started in ICS 111 - Introduction to Computer Science I. My professor, Scott Robertson, was very meticulous with his teachings. He knew more than 3/4th's of the class had probably never
coded a day in their life and so he explained everything in great detail. I learned a lot by the end of my first semester and could finally call myself a programmer. Difficulties started to arise in my second semester with my next class, ICS 211 - Introduction to Computer Science II, taught by Edo Biagioni. Now, by this time I was feeling quite confident in my 
Java coding abilities. I knew how to do all the things like make a function, call a function, make simple data structures, and mess around with them. However, this class humbled me. The homeworks were more like week long projects and the exams were extremely difficult. If I recall correctly, my highest exam grade was 63%! This class is where my self-doubt as a programmer
began but in the end, I managed to pull through and pass the class. And to be quite honest, I enjoyed the challenges I faced. 


## Sophomore year
My sophomore year felt like it passed by quickly. I took ICS 212 - Program Structure with Katy Tarit, and it was essentially ICS 111 and 211 but in the C and C++ program languages. My biggest takeaway from that class was learning the ability to work with others as our final project for that class included me grouping up with a team of six students to create a 
large-scale program. By the end of that class, I felt like I just had a taste of what it would be like working in the software development industry and I quite liked it. 


## Junior year
Presently (at the time of this writing) I am in the second half of my junior year. I have just finished my discrete math courses (ICS 141/241) and am now currently taking ICS 311 - Algorithms with Nodari Stichnava and ICS 314 - Software Engineering I with Brook Conner. I can say with confidence that I enjoy computer science and want to enter the industry
as a software developer, however, I still have some doubts about my abilities. I understand that I am only now just beginning to learn what computer science really is and all of my previous classes were simply foundation building for the bigger picture, but I feel so small and inferior in this gargantuan field of information. I often wonder how I will be able to 
prepare myself for a successful career when I still feel like I don't know anything. Can I really do this?


## To the Future
Looking back and reflecting on my journey of knowledge, I learned much more than I realized. In these two short years back in school, I went from knowing nothing to knowing some things (Ha!). I want to make a promise to myself; that I will continue to learn as much as I can and never give up in the face of a challenge. I believe that if I keep putting in the work, I can
certainly succeed. I mean, if others can do it then why can't I?
